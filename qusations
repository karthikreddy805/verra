Ami creations 
How can we add error handling if the SSM execution fails to start (e.g., wrong instance ID or missing IAM role)?
👉 Right now, the script assumes the execution will always start successfully. Adding a check for empty EXECUTION_ID would make it more robust.

How can we capture and display the actual AMI ID once the creation is successful?
👉 The script only shows “Success,” but does not output the created AMI ID. Fetching it from AutomationExecution.Outputs would be useful.

How can we make the script reusable instead of hardcoding INSTANCE_ID and REGION?
👉 Accepting them as input arguments or environment variables would make the script more flexible for multiple instances/regions.

How can we improve logging and notifications for this script?
👉 Right now, it only prints to the console. Adding logs to a file or sending a notification (e.g., SNS or email) when AMI creation completes would improve operational visibility.

SSM parameter cleanup script

Can we improve efficiency by using aws ssm delete-parameters (batch delete) instead of deleting one parameter at a time?

Should we add pagination support (--next-token) in case there are more parameters than a single describe-parameters call returns?

Would it be helpful to add a dry-run option so we can preview which parameters will be deleted before running the actual deletion?

Should we implement error handling and logging to track which parameters failed to delete?

Do we need to add safety checks (like excluding certain prefixes or asking for confirmation) to avoid accidental deletion of important parameters?

Prod user password change 
How can we add error handling if the aws emr list-studios or list-workspaces command fails (e.g., missing permissions, wrong region)?
👉 Currently, the script assumes the AWS CLI always succeeds.

How can we log deleted workspace details (Studio ID, Workspace ID, Last Modified) into a file for audit/compliance?
👉 Right now, it only prints to the console.

How can we add a dry-run option to preview which workspaces would be deleted before actually deleting them?
👉 This avoids accidental deletion.

How can we make the script reusable by accepting REGION and INACTIVITY_DAYS as input arguments instead of hardcoding them?
👉 At present, they are fixed in the script.
