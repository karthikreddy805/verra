Ami creations 
How can we add error handling if the SSM execution fails to start (e.g., wrong instance ID or missing IAM role)?
👉 Right now, the script assumes the execution will always start successfully. Adding a check for empty EXECUTION_ID would make it more robust.

How can we capture and display the actual AMI ID once the creation is successful?
👉 The script only shows “Success,” but does not output the created AMI ID. Fetching it from AutomationExecution.Outputs would be useful.

How can we make the script reusable instead of hardcoding INSTANCE_ID and REGION?
👉 Accepting them as input arguments or environment variables would make the script more flexible for multiple instances/regions.

How can we improve logging and notifications for this script?
👉 Right now, it only prints to the console. Adding logs to a file or sending a notification (e.g., SNS or email) when AMI creation completes would improve operational visibility.

SSM parameter cleanup script

How can this script be improved to handle large numbers of EC2 instances (pagination support)?
👉 Currently, it may miss results if there are many instances.

How can we extract and display only the Name tag instead of dumping all tags?
👉 Right now, the Tags field shows raw data and can be hard to read.

How can we make the script more reusable by passing the AWS region as an argument instead of hardcoding it?
👉 At present, the region is fixed inside the script.

How can we export the EC2 instance details into a structured format (like CSV/JSON) for auditing purposes?
👉 The script only prints output to the console, which isn’t ideal for reporting.

Prod user password change 
How can we add error handling if the aws emr list-studios or list-workspaces command fails (e.g., missing permissions, wrong region)?
👉 Currently, the script assumes the AWS CLI always succeeds.

How can we log deleted workspace details (Studio ID, Workspace ID, Last Modified) into a file for audit/compliance?
👉 Right now, it only prints to the console.

How can we add a dry-run option to preview which workspaces would be deleted before actually deleting them?
👉 This avoids accidental deletion.

How can we make the script reusable by accepting REGION and INACTIVITY_DAYS as input arguments instead of hardcoding them?
👉 At present, they are fixed in the script.
