Ami creations 
How can we add error handling if the SSM execution fails to start (e.g., wrong instance ID or missing IAM role)?
👉 Right now, the script assumes the execution will always start successfully. Adding a check for empty EXECUTION_ID would make it more robust.

How can we capture and display the actual AMI ID once the creation is successful?
👉 The script only shows “Success,” but does not output the created AMI ID. Fetching it from AutomationExecution.Outputs would be useful.

How can we make the script reusable instead of hardcoding INSTANCE_ID and REGION?
👉 Accepting them as input arguments or environment variables would make the script more flexible for multiple instances/regions.

How can we improve logging and notifications for this script?
👉 Right now, it only prints to the console. Adding logs to a file or sending a notification (e.g., SNS or email) when AMI creation completes would improve operational visibility.
