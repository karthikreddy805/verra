Ami creations 
How can we add error handling if the SSM execution fails to start (e.g., wrong instance ID or missing IAM role)?
üëâ Right now, the script assumes the execution will always start successfully. Adding a check for empty EXECUTION_ID would make it more robust.

How can we capture and display the actual AMI ID once the creation is successful?
üëâ The script only shows ‚ÄúSuccess,‚Äù but does not output the created AMI ID. Fetching it from AutomationExecution.Outputs would be useful.

How can we make the script reusable instead of hardcoding INSTANCE_ID and REGION?
üëâ Accepting them as input arguments or environment variables would make the script more flexible for multiple instances/regions.

How can we improve logging and notifications for this script?
üëâ Right now, it only prints to the console. Adding logs to a file or sending a notification (e.g., SNS or email) when AMI creation completes would improve operational visibility.

SSM parameter cleanup script

Can we improve efficiency by using aws ssm delete-parameters (batch delete) instead of deleting one parameter at a time?

Should we add pagination support (--next-token) in case there are more parameters than a single describe-parameters call returns?

Would it be helpful to add a dry-run option so we can preview which parameters will be deleted before running the actual deletion?

Should we implement error handling and logging to track which parameters failed to delete?

Do we need to add safety checks (like excluding certain prefixes or asking for confirmation) to avoid accidental deletion of important parameters?

Prod user password change 
Can we add pagination handling for both list-studios and list-workspaces in case there are more results than a single API call returns?

Should we add a dry-run option so the script only reports which workspaces would be deleted without actually deleting them?

Would it be useful to add logging to a file (deleted vs skipped workspaces) for auditing and compliance tracking?

Should we add error handling and retries for AWS CLI failures (e.g., network issues or API rate limits)?

Do we want to make REGION and INACTIVITY_DAYS configurable via environment variables or CLI arguments instead of hardcoding them?
